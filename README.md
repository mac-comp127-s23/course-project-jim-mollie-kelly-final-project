 - Technical Requirements: Installation of Java 17
 - Main Class For Game: MainGame.java
 - Arrow keys are used in order to play

## Acknowledge to References: 
For insperation we used the traditional children's game "Duck, Duck Grey Duck" - also known as "Duck, Duck, Goose" - and "Hide-and-Seek." We decided to combine both of these childhood games in order to provide the user with a tour of the most notable sites in the Twin Cities.

For the pixel art, we used a pixel art filter (https://pixel-me.tokyo/en/) and for an editing software we used MediBang Paint Pro (https://medibangpaint.com/en/app-download/) in order to edit accessories and clean up the pixels of our images. The images we used in our game were from fineartamerica.com, https://agutsygirl.com/2018/02/03/forgot-about-rae/what-about-rae-sarahkayhoffman-com-armory-minneapolis-pink-concert-super-bowl/, https://walkerart.org/minnesotabydesign/objects/guthrie-theater-2, https://www.cynthiafroid.com/downtown-digest/2020/10/13/gold-medal-park-in-fall-mill-district.

## Project Shortcomings / Known Issues
Initially, we planned for our game to have three different maps with five additional locations (pinpoints) for each map. This was the vision that we had for our game in order to give the user a proper tour of the Twin Cities. However, due to time constraints we were only able to include one map with five locations (pinpoints).

In our game, we noticed that the user's duck is far too small and sometimes blends into the background, which can confused the user. Then, after the user visits a pinpoint the user's duck will return back to the center of the map instead of staying at the position at which the user was previously in.

## Societal Impact
Our game is designed to give a tour of the Twin Cities; it is primarily aimed for someone that is unfamiliar with the Twin Cities. It is also aimed for those who already live in the Twin Cities but would like to know more about the city's history and a few of its notable locations.

Our code does not have any potential to exclude or cause any harm to any vulnerable populations; our game is meant to simply educate folks on the Twin Cities. We do not anticipate our project to be used for malicious intent or be used in any oppressive situations. To the extent of our knowledge, we do not expect any consequences from our game.
